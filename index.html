        <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>Hey! Thanks for making it this far. So, I grew up in Indianapolis and have lived here most of my life. Some would say
            I have worn too many hats in a short amount of time. I believe it is an advantage because I have more experience and 
            exposure to a variety of situations than many of my peers with the same amount of time in the workforce. When I was done 
            with school, I got into high-volume restaurant management at a place called Kilroy's, if you are familiar. I spent nearly four years
            there managing a staff of 100 employees. My responsibilities included creating the weekly front-of-house schedule, taking inventory of
            our liquor, beer and wine supply to place orders with our distributors, as well as responding to customer service issues. I owe my
            abilty to work, and effectively communicate, with all personality types to this position. Not only did I learn how to lead a staff
            of individuals by earning their trust and respect, I could become a friend of every guest that walked through our doors. I left Kilroy's 
            because I could not see myself maintaining that lifestyle for a career. Working until 3AM, on holidays and weekends while missing
            family events is not something I wanted to do for the long-term. I will always appreciate my time there and the opportunity I was given
            to develop myself professionally and personally. Based on my ability to talk with anyone and everyone, I decided sales would be 
            my next move.
            <br/>
            My first experience in the sales world was a high-volume phone sales job in the highly regulated mortgage industry. After passing
            a strenuous federal exam to get my mortgage loan originator license, NMLS #1647805, I went through an additional 8 weeks of phenomenal
            sales training. Once I was done with training, I was given 200-300 new leads each day, with a database of 30,000+ old leads, and 
            an expectation of dialing 500 of those leads each day. Lucky for me, I was a high-performer from the start and had a much better
            rate of keeping people on the phone and going through the sales process with me than many of my colleagues. Within the first 10 minutes of the phone call I could 
            persuade a complete stranger to give me their social security number over the phone so I could get a credit report, and within 45 minutes
            would have their credit card number to pay for a $500 appraisal fee. My early success lead to my fast promotions first to Team Leader, and
            then to Training Manager.  I really enjoyed training the new employees and helping them find the early success I had. However, I knew
            that high-pressure phone sales was also not going to be my long-term career.
